            <h3>Introduction</h3><br>
            <p>Motherboards are necessary hardware used to connect all circuitry into one functioning component. Where, as stated by 
                Ozsahin et al. (2021), motherboards are a physical component of the computer system, specifically it is a printed circuit 
                board that utilizes each and every component of the computer, exemplifying the fact that each and every distinct piece of
                 hardware is interconnected through the motherboard.</p><br>

            <h3>Discussion</h3><br>
            <p>
                As illustrated in the table, the following types of motherboards’ form factors are identified, and its specifications 
                including its size dimensions, number of Central Processing Unit (CPU) slots, number of memory slots, its application 
                in the real world, allowed BIOS (whether it is Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, UEFI or Legacy), Number of Peripheral
                Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) Slots, Number of Serial Advance Technology Attachment (SATA) ports allowed for use
                and, if applicable, its type (Hard drives or Solid-State Drives), and together with its built-in features.<br><br>

	            Advanced Technology eXtended (ATX) motherboards were developed by Intel in 1995, replacing the older, and slower AT
                motherboards. Where its dimensions measure up to 12 inches by 9.6 inches. It includes 1 CPU Socket, up to 4 memory
                slots, Up to 2 to 3 PCIe slots with a bandwidth of 16x, allowing for the use of graphics card units with 16 high-way
                lanes for high-performance transfer of graphics. It also supports up to 4 to 8 SATA Ports, including NVMe M.2 and SSDs.
                ATX motherboards also support both UEFI and Legacy BIOS. With features including Wi-Fi Support, HDMI and Display Ports,
                USB Ports, Ethernet Connectivity, and CPU-Overclocking depending on the model of the ATX motherboard. ATX motherboards
                are commonly used for personal computers (PCs) at home, for office desktops, or for workstations (ATX: Advanced 
                Technology eXtended - Uncover the Advantages, 2023). <br><br>

	            Subsequently, as per Lolvvv (2023), Extended-ATX (or E-ATX) motherboards measure up to 12 inches by 13 inches with 1 CPU
                slot for standard E-ATX setups and 2 CPU slots for professional setups. It also includes up to 8 memory slots, and
                supports UEFI BIOS for the newer models, where Legacy BIOS is said to have started to be phased out for the newer models,
                with up to 8 PCIe slots and 6 to 8 ports. With the high demanding tasks, it also requires high capacity storage with 6 to 8
                SATA ports. Extended-ATX motherboards are used for high-performance tasks, commonly used in servers, and demanding 
                simulations.<br><br>

                Thereafter, with the Micro-ATX motherboard measuring up to 9.6 by 9.6 inches, this motherboard has 1 CPU slot and can carry 
                up to 4 memory slots, with the minimum of 2 slots. It can support both Legacy or UEFI BIOS, with up to 1 or 2 PCIe slots of
                16x bandwidths. It can support up to 4 to 6 SATA Ports and is compatible with HDMI, or Display Ports. This motherboard also
                features Wi-Fi connectivity. Because of its small design, it is commonly used for small and efficient desktop builds, and 
                home theater PCs, which is essentially a small computer used for streaming entertainment services. Ultimately, its purpose
                saves space while not decreasing efficiency (Why MicroATX Builds Are the Future of Compact PC Gaming, 2023).<br><br>

                Following with the Mini-ITX motherboard measuring up to 6.7 by 6.7 inches featuring 1 CPU socket, up to 2 memory slots, 
                1 PCIe slot, and up to 2 to 4 SATA ports. The Mini-ITX motherboard supports UEFI or Legacy BIOS and includes everything a 
                micro-ATX motherboard has except it is smaller and has lesser memory slots and PCIEe slots. It is also used for small 
                personal computer setups and is a much more versatile option for smaller desktop builds (ITX: Advantages of Using ITX 
                Motherboards & Liquid Cooling in an ITX System, 2023).<br><br>

                Lastly, we have the Mini-ATX motherboard with a size of up to 5.9 by 5.9 inches with 1 CPU socket. It features up to 2 
                memory slots, 1 16x bandwidth PCIe slot, 2 SATA Ports, and supports Legacy or UEFI BIOS, and is commonly developed as 
                small form factor (SFF) devices such as the home theater setups used for streaming entertainment purposes. Its features
                include Wi-Fi connectivity, HDMI and Display Port connections, Storage (SATA), and USB ports. (Mini-ATX: Compact Power for 
                Efficient Builds, 2023).<br><br>

	            Consequently, it is evident that each motherboard has its specific purpose, from use, to variety, and all the way to 
                versatility, it serves as the very backbone of the entire computer system. Without it, each hardware would not function 
                as intended, much like that of the human spine, where the human nervous system connects to and reaches to every part of 
                the human body. The motherboard acts as the spine of the computer system, and links to each and every single piece of 
                hardware in order for the entire system to function.
