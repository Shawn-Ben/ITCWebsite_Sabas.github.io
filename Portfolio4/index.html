            <h3>What is Computer Hardware?</h3><br>
            <p>As per Frankenfeld (1993), Computer Hardware refers to all physical components of a computer system that is responsible 
                for the core processes of a software, such as input and output devices, storage, and  memory allocation devices. Some 
                examples includes the central processing unit (CPU), which is responsible for arithmetic calculations, input devices 
                such as the mouse and keyboard provides direct manipulation and alphabetic features, and output devices such as monitors
                for display visualization and speakers for audio.  Consequently, the Computer Hardware comprises of all electronic 
                circuitry and input output devices, of which requires the software for proper functionality and utilization of the
                components.  (Garrie et al., 2024). 
            </p><br>

            <h3>What is Software?</h3><br>
            <p>
            According to Ugah et al. (2018), software refers to a set of programs that processes as a whole, where it also relies on 
            hardware for its core functions. It is also refered to as the “non-physical” component of a computer system, focusing on 
            user interface, usability, and readability. Furthermore, software relies on input and output devices in order to interact 
            with the user. 
            </p><br>

            <h3>Types of Software</h3><br>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li><h4>System Software</h4><br>Attested by Awati and Lutkevich (2024), system software refers to the computer program that 
                        focuses on the incorporation of hardware and software, where the system software is the layer that hides unreadable
                         lines of code, and provides a user interface for the interaction of both the human and the computer hardware. 
                         An example of system software would be Operating Systems such as: Windows, MacOS, and Android.</li><br>

                    <li><h4>Utility Software</h4><br>As stated by Ferguson and Hebels (2003), Utility Software refers to programs that are 
                        made for functional maintenance of the computer system. It is usually built-in with the operating system, where 
                        programs such as task managers, trash bins, fire walls, and virtual private networks (VPN) are not essential for 
                        the success for the operation of the computer system, but are necessary for  maintenance. Examples of utility
                         software would be: Task manager, trash bin, file management, and the fire wall.</li><br>

                    <li><h4>Application Software</h4><br>Application software or Apps for short, are programs made to run necessary tasks which
                         could either be for work, entertainment, scholarly, or  online communication, where some of these applications 
                         require a word processor, a web browser, or any graphics software in order to function properly. A few examples
                          of application software includes: games, online streaming apps, social media, video or photo editing apps, 
                          programming tools, and banking apps (Applications Software - Software - KS3 Computer Science Revision - BBC 
                          Bitesize, 2023).</li><br>
                    </ol>
            </p><br>

            <h3>Implementation of Hardware and Software in the Different Institutions in the Community</h3><br>
            <p>
                <ul>
                     <li><h4>Education</h4><br>For software, applications such as Zoom and Google Meet are necessary for online 
                        conferences in cases where physical meetings are limited, and Canvas or Google Classroom for a efficient 
                        learning management systems. As for Hardware, low end to middle-end desktops (depending on the school’s budget) 
                        are useful for online and computer related courses or subjects.(EdTech Books, n.d.)</li><br>

                     <li><h4>Healthcare</h4><br>As exemplified by Mehta et al. (1994), Computers have assisted in the advancement of 
                        medicine over the years, with new technology that could monitor heart rates, visualization of anatomies, 
                        computerized hospital information systems, and computerized support-related systems.</li><br>

                     <li><h4>Business Operations</h4><br>A study by Li (2024), emphasized that the rapid development of hardware and 
                        software has improved enterprise management, wherein the automation of stocks, transactions, and management have 
                        increased the ability of business operators to efficiently manage through the help of software and hardware.
                         Basically allowing business owners to work efficiently with the assistance of computer systems.</li><br>

                </ul>
            </p><br><br>

            <h3>Analysis</h3><br>
            <p>
                Within personal belief , Computer Hardware is essentially all electrical circuitry pieces and parts that can be physically touched, 
                and is necessary for the implementation and incorporation of software. Computer hardware plays a vital role in providing input and 
                output processes that allows for human-computer interaction. On the other half, Software is also essential in running and automating 
                programs, tasks, processes, algorithms, and data structures that allows for the logical aspect of hardware to run. This means that, 
                software is responsible for the backend processes such as calculations, logical processes and holding necessary data. Subsequently, 
                these two complement each other in a way such that hardware is that of a human body, capable of physical interactions and abilities, 
                while the software is that of the human mind, with the ability of logical thinking, arithmetic reasoning, and pattern memorization. 
                It is amazing that, humanity has progressed to the point where computers are almost nearly accessible to all, wherein in this progressive 
                technological world, comes digital literacy, which is important in this day and age, for the fact that computer systems could potentially 
                be important assets for future purposes. Consequently, the computer system is made up of both the incorporation of hardware and software 
                into one unit, assisting us humans, in speeding up processes such as simulations, calculations, research, and communication. Modern software
                also provides us with the capability for entertainment via online games, online streaming, and communication applications, and with 
                hardware advancing, simulations and calculations are boosted with efficiency, for example: NASA supercomputers and business organizations
                with their database servers. Consequently, It is important to know the there are dangers that comes with modern technology, these dangers
                are electrical short circuits, which may cause electrical fires, cyber-attacks, cyber-bullying, and electrical-induced explosions from
                un-maintained hardware. Overall, hardware and software go hand in hand, both functioning its own roles.
