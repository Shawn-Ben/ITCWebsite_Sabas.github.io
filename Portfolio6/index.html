            <h3>Introduction</h3><br>
            <p>
                Computers are differentiated into 4 main classifications, namely: Supercomputers, Mainframe Computers, Mini Computers, 
                and Micro Computers, which are also known as Personal Computers (mangala, 2025), while servers and workstations are 
                different types of computers that have their own functions mostly seen in workplaces. The following tables identify, 
                discuss, and analyze the differences of the types of computers, and its specifications. 
            </p><br><br>

            <h3>Discussion</h3><br>
            <p><br>
            <!--This part is for the first table-->
            Table 1 discusses the specifications of supercomputers, mainframe computers, mini computers, and micro computers, specifically, 
            it analyzes the computers’ first prototype or built as an invention and the inventor, memory, processing speed, energy 
            consumption, and its applications or its field of use. This allows for easy understanding and comparison of the specifications 
            of the four main types of computers. <br><br>

            As per Hosch and L (2025), the supercomputer is the fastest and most powerful type of computer, where its field of use is 
            emphasized towards scientific and engineering applications, such as complex mathematical models and simulations. Furthermore, 
            being the fastest computer, its processing speed reaches at about 100 P–FLOPS or Peta–Floating Point Operations Per Second and 
            an allocated memory of 9.2 Petabytes. Its energy consumption depends on the severity of the tasks done, with most supercomputers 
            having more than 10+ Megawatts as their total energy consumption. (How Do Supercomputers Work? Key Features and Examples, 2025).
            <br><br> 

            As stated by GeeksforGeeks (2025), the mainframe computers are used and known for handling vast amounts of server data, and for 
            massive amounts of transactional inputs, this comes with the fact that mainframe computers feature a processing speed of up to 
            100 Million Instructions Per Second (MIPS). Furthermore, mainframe computers usually have 32 Gigabytes up to 40 Terabytes of 
            random access memory, but in the Harvard Mark 1 it features 600,000 bytes of ram (Simon, n.d). Subsequently, mainframe computers are 
            usually measured per thousands of instructions, where in general mainframe computers may consume kilowatt–hour per 12,000 to 18,000 
            transactions (Vippala, 2025). <br><br>

            Whereas, the mini computer is used for the purpose of connecting devices into the same network and is usually meant for fields 
            such as business management, industrial automation, data processing and education, while it features a processing speed of 10 
            up to 30 MIPS (GeekforGeeks, 2025), and is also referred to as small or midsize servers (Wang, 2020). With its memory size at 
            around 1 Gb up to 128 and above Gb depending on the tasks to be done (How Much RAM Do You Really Need for Servers and VPS in 
            2025?, n.d.), with about 500 to 1000 Watts of energy assuming that the server is under normal operations, otherwise it could 
            consume up to 2000 watts (How Much Power Does a Server Use?, n.d.).<br><br>

            Lastly, the micro computer is the smallest and technically the most portable type of computer compared to the rest, it is used 
            for daily operations such as running applications, educational purposes, research, entertainment, and portability, where the 
            Micral N or the intel 8008 featured 16 kilobytes of memory at only 500 kilohertz processing speed (Dad, 2010). Though the power 
            consumption of the Micral N was not specifically stated, most modern micro computers typically run on 200 Watts up to 1000 Watts 
            depending on the hardware of the personal computer.<br><br>

            In table 2, it discusses the description of the following types of computers: supercomputers, mainframe computers, servers, 
            workstations, mini computers, and micro computers. The table also analyzes its real-life applications, or its usage.<br><br>

	        Supercomputers are designed to tackle most heavy computational tasks and can process massive amounts of data at incredible 
            speeds (What Is a Supercomputer and How It Differs From Cloud Computing, 2023), where it is also known as the most powerful 
            type of computer compared to the other classified types of computers, an example of its usage would be found at weather 
            forecasts. It also features a really huge physical body that may encompass an entire room for its entirety to be placed 
            perfectly fit. <br><br>

            Subsequently, mainframe computers are for massive transactional operations. Simply put, mainframe computers are huge data 
            servers that are designed to process massive amounts of transactions from multiple users at a time, with a high level of 
            security and reliability, mostly used for big technological companies and organizations (IBM, 2024).  It features a set of 
            computers similar but slightly smaller to that of a supercomputer, and is set inside huge rectangular cases. <br><br>

            Servers on the other hand, handle complex server processes such as managing multiple user queries, hosting websites, shareable 
            drives for network devices, and database transaction management (Complete Guide to Servers, Types, and Features | Spiceworks, 
            2025). They are placed in rectangular cases and are bigger than workstations, but smaller than mainframe computers. <br><br>

            And foremost, the workstation is built for the purpose of single-user professional work, featuring a dedicated build made for 
            graphics-demanding tasks, such as video editing, three dimensional modeling, graphics rendering, and scientific research. It is 
            built the same way a normal office desktop would look like, but is usually more powerful than the normal office desktop, with a 
            dedicated graphics card unit for graphics-related tasks (How Does a Workstation Differ From Desktop Computers?, 2023). <br><br>

            Next is the Mini Computer, which emphasizes on tasks including industrial automation, scientific research, and business 
            management, where oftentimes also focuses on medium-scale applications rather than heavy computational tasks. It requires less 
            space than the traditional desktop, and is useful for space efficiency (What Is a Minicomputer? Uses, Features, and How It 
            Differs From Mainframes, 2023). <br><br>

	        Consequently, the micro-computer, also known as the personal computer, is the smallest type of computer but has everything a 
            computer needs. It is also designed to be used one person at a time. It includes a single integrated semiconductor chip that 
            contains its Central Processing Unit (CPU), as well as its ram. It also features input and output devices, interconnected 
            through its motherboard. Its form can either be that of a notebook (laptop), a handheld computer (smartphone or tablet), or 
            the desktop computer itself (Wright & Shea, 2024). <br><br>

             <h3>Comparison and Contrast</h3><br>
             <p>
                Computers have different distinct processing speeds, memory capacity, and power consumption needed for the computer to 
                run, with this, a comparison would make it easier to understand and identify the key contrasting differences between 
                servers, workstations, mini computers, and micro computers.
