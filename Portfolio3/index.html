            <h3>What are Number Systems?</h3><br>
            <p>Computer science is the study of computers, computational systems and algorithms. Subsequently it is also a broad area of
            topic with many interrelated disciplines such as the fields: Computer Engineering, Software Engineering, and Information
            Systems (Denning, 1999).</p><br>

            <h3>4 Common Types of Number Systems</h3><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Binary Number System</li>
                <li>Octal Number System</li>
                <li>Decimal Number System</li>
                <li>Hexadecimal Number System</li>
            </ol><br>

            <h3>Binary Number System</h3><br>
            <p>
                According to (Lande, 2014), the binary number system has two states, ‘on’ or ‘go’ which is represented by 1, 
                and ‘off’ or ‘no-go’ represented as 0. Binary number systems are essential in the conditions of electric circuitry, 
                wherein the combination of ones and zeros corresponds to different allocated translations based on the American 
                Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). Binary numbers are also given the base ‘2’ which denotes that it is 
                in a binary number system. Furthermore, the binary number system was said to be discovered by Englishman Thomas Harriot 
                and the Spaniard Juan Caramuel de Lobkowitz from 1606 to 1682 (Ares et al., 2017).
            </p><br>

            <h3>Octal Number System</h3><br>
            <p>As per GeekforGeeks (2023), Octal Number systems include the digits zero to seven (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), and is 
                widely utilized for compact representation of binary numbers, where binary digits grouped to 3 bits is equal to an 
                octal number. Octal numbers are denoted with base ‘8’. 
            </p><br><br>

            <h3>Decimal Number System</h3><br>
            <p>
                Decimal number system is the standard numbering system that is commonly used in daily calculations. Standard counting, 
                calculating and arithmetic operations are done through the decimal number system. The decimal number system is denoted 
                using the base ‘10’, that includes the numbers zero to nine (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). Furthermore, the decimal 
                number system was introduced by Indian mathematicians, and further perfected by medieval islamic mathematicians 
                (Numeral System | Mathematics, n.d.). A binary digit multiplied by 2(position of the digit) and its sum equals a 
                decimal number.
            </p><br>

            <h3>Hexadecimal Number System</h3><br>
            <p>
                In my personal analysis and reflection, number systems play an important role in understanding mathematical problems and 
                their relationships with other systems according to other mathematical or scientific fields. Each number system has its 
                own strengths and weaknesses in how they are applied in real life situations, which is important to understand which 
                number system should be used for a specific purpose. Take for example, the binary number system, using it in day to day 
                life from counting numbers to taxes would be a hassle, unlike using the decimal system, but the decimal system would also 
                be too complicated for a simple ‘on’ or ‘off’ electronic circuit, such as hardware. Furthermore, after understanding the 
                processes of number systems in daily life, number systems play a crucial role in maintaining daily operations, from 
                transportation, to taxes, and even to airline management. Subsequently, number systems allowed for the advancement of 
                technology through the creation of circuitry and all the way to personal computers and  readability of longer binary 
                numbers, and specifying colors in web pages. Overall modern day technology would be nothing without the assistance of 
                the number systems and the efficiency it brings in representing numbers.

            <h3>What are the Uses of Each Number System?</h3><br>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Binary Number System</b><br>The most simplest form of computer data are bits, short for binary digit, 
                        wherein a bit could either be a one (on) or zero (off). Binary is significant because it incorporates the usage 
                        of bits into bigger sizes of data which includes bytes, megabytes, gigabytes and so on, which one's computer 
                        translates and processes. Binary is useful in the field of programming for the reason of being the simplest form 
                        of data (on or off) (Computer Science: Binary, n.d.).</li><br>

                    <li><b>Octal Number System</b><br>According to Plants and Berman (2017), the Octal number system is necessary 
                        in computer processes as it is a number system that has a base 2n. This makes it so that its significance with the 
                        relationship of the binary number system where 3 bits is equal to an octal number, making the octal number system 
                        an efficient way in translating binary numbers for human readability.</li><br>

                    <li><b>Decimal Number System</b><br>In a study by Rosales (2023), the base 10 number system (decimal number system) 
                        is the foundation of all mathematics, and encompasses basic arithmetic and mathematical operations. The decimal 
                        number system is the most widely used number system in daily calculations, and is also said to be the universal 
                        language for expressing numbers, equations, quantities, concepts, and measurements.</li><br>
